<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">As much as we'd like to believe our operating system is perfect, it's not. Like any other piece of software, it has its vulnerabilities that need to be protected. In this article, we're going to walk you through the best ways to take care of your OS's weak points.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">First, let's take a look at what those weak points are. Then we'll go over some general tips for protecting your computer from attack. Finally, we'll give you some specific tips for protecting your OS's most vulnerable areas. Let's get started!</p>

<h2 style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 24px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-weight: bold; text-align: justify;">Basic Operating System security and Maintenance</h2>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">When it comes to the security and maintenance of your operating system, there are a few basic things you need to keep in mind. First and foremost, make sure that you keep your operating system up to date. The latest updates often contain security fixes that can help protect your computer from attack. You should also install a good antivirus program and keep it up to date.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">In addition, <strong><a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/03/31/6-ways-to-back-up-your-data/" target="_blank">you should regularly back up your data</a>.</strong> This is important not just in case of a system crash, but also in case of a ransomware attack or other cybercrime. You can either back up your data to an external hard drive or use a cloud-based service. Finally, be sure to password protect your computer and create strong passwords. This will help prevent unauthorized access to your data.</p>

<h2 style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 24px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-weight: bold; text-align: justify;">Security during configuration and installation</h2>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">When you're installing or configuring your operating system, it's important to be aware of its security weaknesses and take steps to protect yourself from them. Many attackers will try to exploit these weaknesses during this time, so it's critical to be as vigilant as possible.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Some of the most common security weaknesses include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Not using a strong password</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Default accounts and passwords</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Not updating software patches</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Not using firewalls or antivirus software</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 24px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-weight: bold; text-align: justify;">Operating System User Authentication</h2>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">User authentication is one of the most important operating system security measures because it protects access to system resources. User authentication verifies the identity of a user before granting access to system resources. There are three types of user authentication: The most common form of authentication is a username and password, but this can be vulnerable to attacks like brute force attacks, where someone tries to guess the password.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Two-factor authentication, which requires both something you know and something you have, is much more secure. For example, you might have to enter a username and password, as well as a code that is sent to your phone. The strongest form of authentication is something you are, like fingerprint or iris recognition. This can't be guessed or stolen, so it's the most secure way to protect your operating system.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 115%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Operating system weak points can be exploited by malicious attackers to gain access to sensitive data or take control of systems. To mitigate these risks, it is important to keep systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and to use strong security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
